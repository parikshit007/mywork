simple class which parses a URL
 
The constructor should accept a full or a partial URL, then I could get the different parts of it, e.g. protocol, host, path, etc. through getters.
No setters needed, this would be an immutable object class.
There should be a __toString() method implemented, so I could cast my $url object to a string easily, e.g. echo (string)$url;
There should be unit tests for all public methods.
 if the class would normalize the path of the URL on instantiation, so if the input URL has a path with '.' or '..' in it, those would be removed.
